    <p>
      <strong>A system for interactive display of pictures on multiple screens/projectors controlled by tablets.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Suppose one or a few photography clubs will have an interactive picture exhibition with the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pictures from the members should be displayed on screens/projectors.</li>
      <li>It should be possible to display a picture simultaneously on multiple screens/projectors.</li>
      <li>The viewing should be controlled by thumbnails on a tablet.</li>
      <li>When a thumbnail is clicked the corresponding picture should be displayed on the associated screens/projectors.</li>
      <li>When their has not been a thumbnail click for a while a slide-show should be run.</li>
      <li>It should be possible to run the exhibition in many rooms by using multiple tablets each with its own set of screens/projectors.</li>
      <li>Many clubs should have the possibility to take part in the exhibition but they should be independent of each other.</li>
      <li>To be fair to the photographers all should have equal chance of getting there thumbnails placed on a specific spot on a tablet.</li>
      <li>
        <em>"club" should be used in a broad sense. It could be just pictures from a specific theme like street photography, birds, cars, etc.</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>This system has:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the control a client-side rendered webpage with thumbnails runs a tablet.</li>
      <li>A client-side rendered webpage will display the pictures on screens/projectors on demand from a tablet or a slideshow.</li>
      <li>A node.js JavaScript webserver application and a few scripts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-parts">The parts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A Linux server will run the iapg SW and keep the directories for the pictures.</li>
      <li>If you just want a minimal setup use one tablet with "connected" screens/projectors and a "club-directory" with one sub-directory for each photographer for their pictures.</li>
      <li>You can use multiple tablets to request thumbnails from the same "club-directory" which on a click will show the corresponding picture on the related screens/projectors.</li>
      <li>If you want to run for many clubs each club will have a "club-directory", tablets and screens/projectors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To make it simple you could use <code>/home/your-user</code> as the directory for the system.</li>
      <li>Each club will have its own club-directory. In the range: <code>club-53001, club-53011, club-53021 ... club-53991</code>.</li>
      <li>In the club-directory each photographer will have a sub-directory with the name of the photographer</li>
      <li>Each photographer will store pictures in a directory like <code>./iapg-main/html/club-53001/Louis Daguerre/A picture worth showing.jpg</code>.
<ul><li>where <code>iapg-main</code> is the base directory of the system.</li><li>where <code>club-53001</code> is the directory for the club.</li><li>and "<code>Louis Daguerre</code>" is the sub-directory for the photographer.</li></ul></li>
      <li>Because a signature picture of the photographer will be shown on the tablet a picture with the name of the photographer(+.jpg) must exist in his directory.
<ul><li>"<code>Louis Daguerre.jpg</code>".</li></ul></li>
      <li>The signature picture will be shown as the first thumbnail in the block of the photographer but it is not meant to be displayed on the screens/projectors (and is thus not clickable)</li>
      <li>All other pictures will be displayed in ascending order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>Each photographer will get a random position for the pictures on the tablet.</em>
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-principles-for-storing-the-pictures-on-the-server">The principles for storing the pictures on the server.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Explained by examples</strong>
    </p>
    <p>With only one tablet (that is one club) each photographer will have a sub-directory in:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>./iapg-main/html/club-53001/</code>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>./Tor Jordsson/</code> (for member "Tor Jordsson")</li>
          <li>
            <code>./Tölva Talvölva/</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With several clubs of photographers each club will have an own directory with sub-directories per photographer:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Club 1 <code>./iapg-main/html/club-53001/</code><ul><li><code>./Freja Njordsdottir/</code></li><li><code>./Balder Friggsson/</code></li></ul></li>
      <li>Club 2 <code>./iapg-main/html/club-53011/</code><ul><li><code>./Natt Norvesdottir/</code></li></ul></li>
      <li>Club 3 <code>./iapg-main/html/club-53021/</code><ul><li><code>./Oden Skaldemjöd/</code></li></ul></li>
    </ol>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="hw-and-sw">HW and SW</h2>
    <p>node.js is used as the web-server.</p>
    <p>The system is tested on Windows10 with Debian in an Oracle VM and on a Raspberry PI4 with raspian.</p>
    <p>You can try the system in a computer with  node.js and use one browser as the  "tablet" and another one as the screen/projector.</p>
    <h3 id="installation-on-debianraspian">Installation on Debian/Raspian</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>To install the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment</strong>
      <br />
      <code>sudo apt-get install node.js</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>To install the iapg kit</strong>
      <br />
Firstly go to <code>/home/your-user</code></p>
    <p>Then browse to <a href="https://github.com/pg-andersson/iapg">https://github.com/pg-andersson/iapg</a> and click on "&lt;&gt;Code" and then "Download ZIP"<br />
Github will create <code>iapg-main.zip</code> which will be copied to Downloads.</p>
    <p>Then <code>unzip</code> which will create the directory <code>iapg-main</code> and extract the files to it.<br /><code>unzip Downloads/iapg-main.zip</code>   (<em><strong>Important it is your-user</strong></em>)</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Finally install the dependencies</strong>
      <br />
Go to the just created directory <code>/home/your-user/iapg-main</code> and run:<br /><code>npm install</code>   (<em><strong>Important it is your-user</strong></em>)</p>
    <h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
    <p>System parameters are stored in <code>./iapg-main/etc/iapg.conf</code>.<br />
The two most important are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>waittime_before_slideshow_starts = 60</code> After 60 seconds display of a picture a slideshow will begin or resume until a thumbnail is pressed.</li>
      <li>
        <code>pict_displaytime_slideshow = 10</code> During a slideshow a picture is displayed for 10 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="three-scenarios-are-presented-here">Three scenarios are presented here</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>A club will have a small exhibition.<br />
The club will be called club-53001 and will have one tablet and at least one screen.</li>
      <li>A club will use three rooms to show the same pictures but the showings must be independent of each other.<br />
The club will be called club-53011 and will have three tablets and a lot of screens.</li>
      <li>Two clubs will have an exhibition together.
<ol><li>One club will be called club-53021.</li><li>The other club will be club-53031.</li></ol></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="the-server">The server</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>To start the system run in ./iapg-main as your-user:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>bash iapg_start.sh club-53001:1</code> (Club-53001 will use the directory club-53001 and have one (:1) tablet)</li>
      <li>
        <code>bash iapg_start.sh club-53011:3</code> (Club-53011 will use the directory club-53011 and have three (:3) tablets)</li>
